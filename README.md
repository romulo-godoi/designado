## ‚ú® Key Features

    *   **Duplicate Prevention:** Warns you if you try to add the same assignment on the same day.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Note: Data Storage

*   **Local Only:** Your assignment data is saved **only** within the browser you use on the device you use. It is **not** backed up online or synced across devices.

*   **Browser/Profile Specific:** Data saved in one browser (e.g., Chrome) is not accessible in another (e.g., Firefox). Data saved in a specific user profile is not accessible in another profile on the same computer.
*   **Incognito/Private Mode:** Data entered in private browsing modes is typically deleted when the private window is closed.
